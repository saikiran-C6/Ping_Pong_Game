# Ping_Pong_Game

## Introduction

Ping Pong is a classic two-player game where players control rods to hit a ball back and forth. This project aims to create a simplified and easy-to-understand version of the game, with the following key features and rules:

## Features

1. **Two Rods:** There will be two rods, one at the top and one at the bottom of the screen.

2. **Dual Control:** Both rods will move together and will be controlled using the 'A' and 'D' keys (although other keys can be used for movement).

3. **Alert for Highest Score:** When the game starts, an alert will be displayed showing the highest score achieved and the name of the player who scored it. If no record exists, it will indicate, "This is your first time."

4. **High Score Storage:** If a player achieves the highest score, their name and max score will be stored in local storage.

5. **Alert for Winning Player:** After every round, an alert will be displayed indicating the winning player and their score.

6. **Round Start:** Each round begins when the 'Enter' key is pressed, although another key can also be used to initiate the round.

7. **Horizontal Movement:** The rods will only move horizontally using the 'A' and 'D' keys, although other keys are also accepted for movement.

8. **Rods Reset:** The losing rod gets the ball for the next match, and both rods and the ball are reset to the center.

9. **Scoring:** The score is counted from the start of each match.

## Getting Started
